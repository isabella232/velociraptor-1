Overview
========

Velociraptor (VR) seeks to create repeatable deployments by technical and
non-technical users across a suite of languages, providing the
service commonly knows as Platform as a Service or PaaS.

VR is inspired by `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ and in particular
the `12-factor methodology <http://12factor.net>`_. VR supports
the use of buildpacks for flexible, pluggable building of source
code into apps suitable for deployment into Linux containers (lxc).

Getting Started
---------------

In September 2015, `Jason presented Velociraptor to DCPython
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktaF-2o-ZZA>`_. It's long
(45 minutes!) but provides an overview of what VR is and how
it works.

Alternatively, view
`the presentation slides <_static/Presentation.key>`_
(`PDF <_static/Presentation.pdf>`_)
for an outline of the talk.
