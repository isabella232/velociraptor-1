Overview
========

Velociraptor (VR) seeks to create repeatable deployments by technical and
non-technical users across a suite of languages, providing the
service commonly knows as Platform as a Service or PaaS.

VR is inspired by `Heroku <https://heroku.com>`_ and in particular
the `12-factor methodology <http://12factor.net>`_. VR supports
the use of buildpacks for flexible, pluggable building of source
code into apps suitable for deployment into Linux containers (lxc).
