Meet Velociraptor
=================

Velociraptor is a Django- and Celery-powered web application for building and
deploying software services.  It is /very/ opinionated about how this should be
done, adhering (with one or two exceptions) to the `Twelve Factor App`_
methodology.

Development
===========

VM
~~

The smoothest way to get running is to start up a VM with the included
Vagrantfile.  This requires having VirtualBox_ and Vagrant_ installed.  Once
they're installed, just type 'vagrant up' in this repo's root, wait for the
lucid64 VM image download, and you should get a local VM running with all of
Velociraptor's system-level dependencies (e.g. RabbitMQ).  If you 'vagrant ssh'
to enter the environment, the Velociraptor source code will be at /vagrant.

Provisioning of system-level dependencies inside the VM is done using Vagrant's
Puppet provisioner.  You can see the Puppet manifest at manifests/yhost.pp.

Database
~~~~~~~~

There is a dbsetup.sql file included that will create the database used by
Velociraptor.  You can change the database settings by editing the settings.py
file.

Python Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Velociraptor contains a requirements.txt file listing its Python dependencies.
You can install them with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

Dev Server
~~~~~~~~~~

Velociraptor is composed of two main processes:

1. The main web service.
2. A Celery daemon that starts and controls one or more workers.

There is a Procfile included with Velociraptor that can be used to run a
development environment with both of these processes.  To use it, you must have
Foreman_ installed.  This is done for you by default if you use the provided
Vagrant VM.

With Foreman installed, you can start up your dev environment by running this::

  foreman start -f Procfile.dev
