Meet Velociraptor
=================

Velociraptor is a Django- and Celery-powered web application for building and
deploying software services.  It is *very* opinionated about how this should be
done, adhering (with one or two exceptions) to the `Twelve Factor App`_
methodology.

Velociraptor is language agnostic.  It can deploy apps in Python, PHP, Ruby,
Node.js, Java, Scala, Go, or any other language that runs on Linux.

Velociraptor supports zero downtime deployment for apps that include
`uptests <http://velociraptor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/uptests.html>`_.
